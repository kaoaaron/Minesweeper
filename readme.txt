This is a simplified version of the classic game minesweeper.

To run this in the terminal, either enter:

python minesweeper.py

OR

python minesweeper.py ## (the number is used for random seed)

*Note: numpy needs to be installed

Story behind the creation:

My friend told me he was making a minesweeper game in his CSC 110 class at UVic and I was
interested in doing one as well. I asked for the documentation for the assignment, and
added my own little twists.

Special Thanks Goes to:

Dr. Zastre whose Documentation is what I built off on
Chris from Chris.com for his ASCII art
